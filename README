See http://hostilefork.com/blackhighlighter/ for information about this project.

It has been ported from Django to Node.js

The Django code is frozen in the django-blackhighlighter subdirectory


NOTE ABOUT THE LICENSE
----------------------

I'm a pretty strong believer in the Stallman-style of "Software Freedom".  It would
be a better world if those who adapted free software (and then deployed it to
users) would share their adaptations back with the community.  His arguments have
always seemed pretty solid to me:

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html

So I tend to err on the side of conservatism in using GPL-style licenses.  The AGPL
closes the "hole" in the GPL so that giving access to a program running GPL code on a
server requires provision of any source adaptations made in that case.  Not that this
is terribly profound code or anything, but it does take time to sort out and write.

If you are interested in applying Blackhighlighter in your project and the license is
too restrictive and a barrier to doing so, please contact me.  I'd loosen it if there
was a good reason to.  Note that as people like Jack Slocum have learned, it's better
to relax a license than tighten it after you've set expectations in your community:

CONVENTIONS

Node.js directory structure chosen to follow this suggestion:

Where I am given a choice, filenames use dashes for spaces:

JSON properties use underscores, consistent with the majority of popular APIs:
