# A letter is made up of a series of numbered redactions, in order
# LET = RED1 RED2 RED3 RED4 .... RED(N)
#
# Each redaction is a member of a "reveal"
# REV1 = RED1 RED4
# REV2 = RED2 RED3
# REV(N) = RED(...) RED(...) RED(...)
#
# A reveal may be published or secret
# If a reveal is published, it has an associated publication date
#
# For implementation convenience, the public portion of the text is implemented 
# as a "reveal" group whose publication date matches the date on the letter

	# Every redaction is part of a reveal
	reveal = models.ForeignKey(Reveal)
	
	# This is the foreign key to the letter, which should be the same as
	# reveal.letter -- it is not strictly necessary to have this redundancy,
	# because you could always write:
	#
	#	for redaction in Redaction.objects.filter(reveal__letter=letter):
	#
	# instead of:
	#
	# 	for redaction in letter.redaction_set:
	#
	# However, there are two good reasons for this redundancy at the 
	# time of this writing.  One is that django has no decent way to
	# edit the case of three classes linked by foreign keys in the admin
	# interface:
	#
	# 	http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/7912f4871d23f985/60e33cf2fb8c4e33
	#
	# The other good reason for keeping this here is that we can add an
	# integrity check that the letter UUID and order are unique together,
	# which as far as I know can't be done across tables.
	#
	# REVIEW: See if this field can be removed at a later date when the
	# admin interface has improved.

	# that submitted the letter, and it does not need to match the actual
