<p>Here is the letter in its current viewable form.  Blacked out
portions have been protected by the author and have not been revealed
on the server (or by a certificate local to your browser).  Text you see 
with a yellow background has been verified in your browser, but hasn't
been transmitted to the server.  Text with a green background was at 
one time hidden but has since been revealed to the general public.</p>

{# We generate the public HTML on the server side because we want the page to be readable without JavaScript #}
{# REVIEW: ensure we've sanitized the HTML, as we are using the "safe" filter! #}

<p>You can either add new verification certificates to read the letter, or if you
choose, reveal its contents.</p>
