All of blackhighlighter depends on a base.html file which is likely shared 
for your entire site.  This sets up some of the minimum expectations of 
what blocks need to be in the base.html.  For instance, you must include
jquery and jquery UI... and set up a params-javascript block.

You will probably want to copy and customize this file.

	I went and picked the first CSS layout that behaved like I wanted.  I found it at:

		http://layouts.ironmyers.com/100_percent_Layouts/layout/?id=49

 	For better or worse, it uses the YUI CSS framework.  What is a CSS framework, you ask?

		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework
  
	It looks silly to me, but the premise is that different browsers made different choices;
	such as with spacing or whether a "h1" header should be 10 or 20 pixels tall.  To get
	around this, YUI has a "reset" that un-styles all the elements, and then it adds them
	all back in a way that will give you the same values in various browsers.

	Whether this is good or bad is beyond me.  It is, however, not compatible with jquery ui.
	This despite the fact that in this discussion someone says that it is:
   
		http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/styling_buttons_and_toolbars_with_the_jquery_ui_css_framework/ 

	Example incompatibilities are seen with the way the margins look on alert messages, or
	the sudden appearance of outlining bullets on the tabs.  I've worked around these but
	would be happy enough with a solution that didn't involve using YUI-CSS.
	
	REVIEW: I have been debating whether having the credits and copyright span the whole
	page is better, or if having them only be as wide as the left panel is better.  I
	commented out the part that made it span the whole page.

	"There is a trick that was written about a while ago (maybe on ALA) that 
	 resets the font sizes for the entire site so that 1.0em is the same as 10px.
	 body { font-size: 62.5% }"
	See: http://www.blogherald.com/2006/09/08/css-tips-and-tricks/

	jQuery UI uses this.  After shrinking your page, it sets things to 1.3em to bring
	them back up to "normal" size.  However...

	"This is pretty bogus, because text inside input boxes doesn't rescale
	 (at least, not in FireFox,) and it obviously applies to the entire page, when 
	 in fact you may want it to just apply to the UI widgets only."

	<p><b>NOTE:</b> This is a demonstration installation of the <a href="http://hostilefork.com/blackhighlighter/">blackhighlighter</a> app.  I wanted a sandbox for people to try out the functionality, to show that it actually works and to perhaps motivate others to contribute to the project.  It is running on a very inexpensive server hosting account and I do not have the capacity to store letters permanently.  In fact, I'll probably be wiping the database rather often.  So please use this for testing only!  (That's why it says "sandbox") :)</p>
